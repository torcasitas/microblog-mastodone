# Microblog cloned a la Mastodone

Using this sample backend, we want you to build a React app that starts on a screen of posts
where each post has the title and body visible. A boring microblog clone a la Mastodon. You can
use this API to pull posts https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. Clicking on a post should
show a new screen that is like a detail screen for that post. It can include comments for that post
from this route https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments. Also include a way to
view more posts by the same author somewhere on the screen. Clicking in can take you to a
new screen similar to the first screen but only for the selected author. These screens can be
nested as much as you want. For example, click on a post, click on more posts by that author,
click on a post, etc.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
